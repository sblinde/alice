            <span class="headline rellax" data-rellax-speed="5">Alice,</span><br>
            are you alright?<br>
            <span class="colors">Have the colours run?</span><br>
            Did he leave you <span class="black">black</span> and <span class="white">white?</span><br>
            Have you been filling up<br>
            those empty cups again?
          </p>

          <p>
            <span class="headline rellax right" data-rellax-speed="5">Oh Alice,</span><br>
            there's no reflection<br>
            in the looking glass<br>
            You wear your party dress<br>
            But there's no party to attend
          </p>
          <p>

            Did you know, when your story's told<br>
            They are leaving out what your future holds?<br>
            <span class="white">Don't you feel trapped underground?</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            Down the rabbit hole he left you alone<br>
            You call that love?<br>
            This was a garden grown where no care was shown<br>
            <span class="black">You call that love?</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Did you think that you could live your life<br>
            If there's no wonder left in paradise?<br>
            Just a pack of cards<br>
            Without the hearts<br>
          <span class="white"><strong>you can't call that love</strong></span>
          </p>
